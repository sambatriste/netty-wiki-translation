## Preface
### The Problem

Nowadays we use general purpose applications or libraries to communicate with each other. For example, we often use an HTTP client library to retrieve information from a web server and to invoke a remote procedure call via web services.

However, a general purpose protocol or its implementation sometimes does not scale very well. It is like we don't use a general purpose HTTP server to exchange huge files, e-mail messages, and near-realtime messages such as financial information and multiplayer game data. What's required is a highly optimized protocol implementation which is dedicated to a special purpose. For example, you might want to implement an HTTP server which is optimized for AJAX-based chat application, media streaming, or large file transfer. You could even want to design and implement a whole new protocol which is precisely tailored to your need.

Another inevitable case is when you have to deal with a legacy proprietary protocol to ensure the interoperability with an old system. What matters in this case is how quickly we can implement that protocol while not sacrificing the stability and performance of the resulting application.

## The Solution

_[The Netty project](http://netty.io/)_ is an effort to provide an asynchronous event-driven network application framework and tooling for the rapid development of maintainable high-performance Â· high-scalability protocol servers and clients.

In other words, Netty is a NIO client server framework which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server development.

'Quick and easy' does not mean that a resulting application will suffer from a maintainability or a performance issue. Netty has been designed carefully with the experiences earned from the implementation of a lot of protocols such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP, and various binary and text-based legacy protocols. As a result, Netty has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and flexibility without a compromise.

Some users might already have found other network application framework that claims to have the same advantage, and you might want to ask what makes Netty so different from them. The answer is the philosophy where it is built on. Netty is designed to give you the most comfortable experience both in terms of the API and the implementation from the day one. It is not something tangible but you will realize that this philosophy will make your life much easier as you read this guide and play with Netty.

## Getting Started

This chapter tours around the core constructs of Netty with simple examples to let you get started quickly. You will be able to write a client and a server on top of Netty right away when you are at the end of this chapter.

If you prefer top-down approach in learning something, you might want to start from Chapter 2, Architectural Overview and get back here.

### Before Getting Started

The minimum requirements to run the examples which are introduced in this chapter are only two; the latest version of Netty and JDK 1.7 or above. The latest version of Netty is available in [the project download page](http://netty.io/downloads.html). To download the right version of JDK, please refer to your preferred JDK vendor's web site.

As you read, you might have more questions about the classes introduced in this chapter. Please refer to the API reference whenever you want to know more about them. All class names in this document are linked to the online API reference for your convenience. Also, please don't hesitate to [contact the Netty project community](http://netty.io/community.html) and let us know if there's any incorrect information, errors in grammar and typo, and if you have a good idea to improve the documentation.

### Writing a Discard Server

The most simplistic protocol in the world is not 'Hello, World!' but [`DISCARD`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc863). It's a protocol which discards any received data without any response.

To implement the `DISCARD` protocol, the only thing you need to do is to ignore all received data. Let us start straight from the handler implementation, which handles I/O events generated by Netty.

```java
package io.netty.example.discard;

import io.netty.channel.ChannelHandlerContext;
import io.netty.channel.ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter;
import io.netty.channel.MessageList;

/**
 * Handles a server-side channel.
 */
public class DiscardServerHandler extends ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter { // (1)

    @Override
    public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageList<Object> msgs) { // (2)
        // Discard the received data silently.
        msgs.releaseAllAndRecycle();
    }

    @Override
    public void exceptionCaught(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Throwable cause) { // (3)
        // Close the connection when an exception is raised.
        cause.printStackTrace();
        ctx.close();
    }
}
```

1. `DiscardServerHandler` extends [`ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter`], which is an implementation of [`ChannelInboundHandler`]. [`ChannelInboundHandler`] provides various event handler methods that you can override. For now, it is just enough to extend [`ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter`] rather than to implement the handler interface by yourself.
1. We override the `messageReceived()` event handler method here. This method is called with a [`MessageList`], which contains the list of received buffers, whenever new data is received from a client. In this example, we just discard the received data by calling `releaseAllAndRecycle()` on the [`MessageList`] to implement the `DISCARD` protocol.
1. The `exceptionCaught()` event handler method is called with a Throwable when an exception was raised by Netty due to an I/O error or by a handler implementation due to the exception thrown while processing events. In most cases, the caught exception should be logged and its associated channel should be closed here, although the implementation of this method can be different depending on what you want to do to deal with an exceptional situation. For example, you might want to send a response message with an error code before closing the connection.

So far so good. We have implemented the first half of the `DISCARD` server. What's left now is to write the `main()` method which starts the server with the `DiscardServerHandler`.

```java
package io.netty.example.discard;
    
import io.netty.bootstrap.ServerBootstrap;
import io.netty.channel.ChannelFuture;
import io.netty.channel.ChannelInitializer;
import io.netty.channel.EventLoopGroup;
import io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoopGroup;
import io.netty.channel.socket.SocketChannel;
import io.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioServerSocketChannel;
    
/**
 * Discards any incoming data.
 */
public class DiscardServer {
    
    private final int port;
    
    public DiscardServer(int port) {
        this.port = port;
    }
    
    public void run() throws Exception {
        EventLoopGroup bossGroup = new NioEventLoopGroup(); // (1)
        EventLoopGroup workerGroup = new NioEventLoopGroup();
        try {
            ServerBootstrap b = new ServerBootstrap(); // (2)
            b.group(bossGroup, workerGroup)
             .channel(NioServerSocketChannel.class) // (3)
             .childHandler(new ChannelInitializer<SocketChannel>() { // (4)
                 @Override
                 public void initChannel(SocketChannel ch) throws Exception {
                     ch.pipeline().addLast(new DiscardServerHandler());
                 }
             })
             .option(ChannelOption.SO_BACKLOG, 128)          // (5)
             .childOption(ChannelOption.SO_KEEPALIVE, true); // (6)
    
            // Bind and start to accept incoming connections.
            ChannelFuture f = b.bind(port).sync(); // (7)
    
            // Wait until the server socket is closed.
            // In this example, this does not happen, but you can do that to gracefully
            // shut down your server.
            f.channel().closeFuture().sync();
        } finally {
            workerGroup.shutdownGracefully();
            bossGroup.shutdownGracefully();
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        int port;
        if (args.length > 0) {
            port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        } else {
            port = 8080;
        }
        new DiscardServer(port).run();
    }
}
```

1. [`NioEventLoopGroup`] is a multithreaded event loop that handles I/O operation.  Netty provides various [`EventLoopGroup`] implementations for different kind of transports. We are implementing a server-side application in this example, and therefore two [`NioEventLoopGroup`] will be used. The first one, often called 'boss', accepts an incoming connection. The second one, often called 'worker', handles the traffic of the accepted connection once the boss accepts the connection and registers the accepted connection to the worker.  How many Threads are used and how they are mapped to the created [`Channel`]s depends on the [`EventLoopGroup`] implementation and may be even configurable via a constructor.
1. [`ServerBootstrap`] is a helper class that sets up a server. You can set up the server using a [`Channel`] directly. However, please note that this is a tedious process, and you do not need to do that in most cases.
1. Here, we specify to use the [`NioServerSocketChannel`] class which is used to instantiate a new [`Channel`] to accept incoming connections.
1. The handler specified here will always be evaluated by a newly accepted [`Channel`]. The [`ChannelInitializer`] is a special handler that is purposed to help a user configure a new [`Channel`].  It is most likely that you want to configure the [`ChannelPipeline`] of the new [`Channel`] by adding some handlers such as `DiscardServerHandler` to implement your network application.  As the application gets complicated, it is likely that you will add more handlers to the pipeline and extract this anonymous class into a top level class eventually.
1. You can also set the parameters which are specific to the `Channel` implementation. We are writing a TCP/IP server, so we are allowed to set the socket options such as `tcpNoDelay` and `keepAlive`. Please refer to the apidocs of [`ChannelOption`] and the specific [`ChannelConfig`] implementations to get an overview about the supported `ChannelOption`s.
1. Did you notice `option()` and `childOption()`?  `option()` is for the [`NioServerSocketChannel`] that accepts incoming connections. `childOption()` is for the [`Channel`]s accepted by the parent [`ServerChannel`], which is [`NioServerSocketChannel`] in this case.
1. We are ready to go now. What's left is to bind to the port and to start the server. Here, we bind to the port `8080` of all NICs (network interface cards) in the machine. You can now call the `bind()` method as many times as you want (with different bind addresses.)

Congratulations! You've just finished your first server on top of Netty.

### Looking into the Received Data

Now that we have written our first server, we need to test if it really works. The easiest way to test it is to use the *telnet* command. For example, you could enter `telnet localhost 8080` in the command line and type something.

However, can we say that the server is working fine? We cannot really know that because it is a discard server. You will not get any response at all. To prove it is really working, let us modify the server to print what it has received.

We already know that [`MessageList`] is filled whenever data is received and the `messageReceived` handler method will be invoked. Let us put some code into the `messageReceived` method of the `DiscardServerHandler`:

```java
@Override
public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageList<Object> msgs) {
    MessageList<ByteBuf> messages = msgs.cast();
    try {
        for (ByteBuf in: messages) {
            while (in.readable()) { // (1)
                System.out.println((char) buf.readByte());
                System.out.flush();
            }
        }
    } finally {
        msgs.releaseAllAndRecycle(); // (2)
    }
}
```

1. This inefficient loop can actually be simplified to: `System.out.println(buf.toString(io.netty.util.CharsetUtil.US_ASCII))`
1. `MessageList.releaseAllAndRecycle()` releases all reference-counted pooled messages and returns itself to the object pool.

If you run the *telnet* command again, you will see the server prints what has received.

The full source code of the discard server is located in the [`io.netty.example.discard`] package of the distribution.

### Writing an Echo Server

So far, we have been consuming data without responding at all. A server, however, is usually supposed to respond to a request. Let us learn how to write a response message to a client by implementing the [`ECHO`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc862) protocol, where any received data is sent back.

The only difference from the discard server we have implemented in the previous sections is that it sends the received data back instead of printing the received data out to the console. Therefore, it is enough again to modify the `messageReceived()` method:

```java
    @Override
    public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageList<Object> msgs) {
        ctx.write(msgs); // (1)
    }
```

1. A [`ChannelHandlerContext`] object has a reference to its associated [`Channel`]. Here, the returned [`Channel`] represents the connection which received the [`MessageList`]. We can get the [`Channel`] and call the `write()` method to write something back to the remote peer.

If you run the *telnet* command again, you will see the server sends back whatever you have sent to it.

The full source code of the echo server is located in the [`io.netty.example.echo`] package of the distribution.

### Writing a Time Server

The protocol to implement in this section is the [`TIME`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc868) protocol. It is different from the previous examples in that it sends a message, which contains a 32-bit integer, without receiving any requests and loses the connection once the message is sent. In this example, you will learn how to construct and send a message, and to close the connection on completion.

Because we are going to ignore any received data but to send a message as soon as a connection is established, we cannot use the `messageReceived()` method this time. Instead, we should override the `channelActive()` method. The following is the implementation: 

```java
package org.jboss.netty.example.time;

public class TimeServerHandler extends ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter {

    @Override
    public void channelActive(final ChannelHandlerContext ctx) { // (1)
        final ByteBuf time = ctx.alloc().buffer(4); // (2)
        time.writeInt((int) (System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000L + 2208988800L);
        
        final ChannelFuture f = ctx.write(time);
        f.addListener(new ChannelFutureListener() {
            @Override
            public void operationComplete(ChannelFuture future) {
                assert f == future;
                ctx.close();
            }
        });
    }
    
    @Override
    public void exceptionCaught(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Throwable cause) {
        cause.printStackTrace();
        ctx.close();
    }
}
```

1. As explained, the `channelActive()` method will be invoked when a connection is established and ready to generate traffic.  Let's write a 32-bit integer that represents the current time in thie method.
1. To send a new message, we need to allocate a new buffer which will contain the message. We are going to write a 32-bit integer, and therefore we need a [`ByteBuf`] whose capacity is at least 4 bytes. Get the current [`ByteBufAllocator`] via `ChannelHandlerContext.alloc()` and allocate a new buffer.
1. As usual, we write the constructed message.

   But wait, where's the flip? Didn't we used to call `java.nio.ByteBuffer.flip()` before sending a message in NIO? `ByteBuf` does not have such a method because it has two pointers; one for read operations and the other for write operations. The writer index increases when you write something to a `ByteBuf` while the reader index does not change. The reader index and the writer index represents where the message starts and ends respectively.

   In contrast, NIO buffer does not provide a clean way to figure out where the message content starts and ends without calling the flip method. You will be in trouble when you forget to flip the buffer because nothing or incorrect data will be sent. Such an error does not happen in Netty because we have different pointer for different operation types. You will find it makes your life much easier as you get used to it -- a life without flipping out!

   Another point to note is that the `ChannelHandlerContext.write()` method returns a [`ChannelFuture`]. A [`ChannelFuture`] represents an I/O operation which has not yet occurred. It means, any requested operation might not have been performed yet because all operations are asynchronous in Netty. For example, the following code might close the connection even before a message is sent:

   ```java
   Channel ch = ...;
   ch.write(message);
   ch.close();
   ```

   Therefore, you need to call the `close()` method after the [`ChannelFuture`] is complete, which was returned by the `write()` method, notifies you when the write operation has been done. Please note that, `close()` also might not close the connection immediately, and it returns a [`ChannelFuture`].

1. How do we get notified when a write request is finished then? This is as simple as adding a [`ChannelFutureListener`] to the returned `ChannelFuture`. Here, we created a new anonymous [`ChannelFutureListener`] which closes the `Channel` when the operation is done.

   Alternatively, you could simplify the code using a pre-defined listener:

   ```java
   f.addListener(ChannelFutureListener.CLOSE);
   ```

To test if our time server works as expected, you can use the UNIX `rdate` command: 

```
$ rdate -o <port> -p <host>
```
where `<port>` is the port number you specified in the `main()` method and `<host>` is usually `localhost`.
