Netty has a module called 'netty-microbench' which performs a series of micro-benchmark tests.  It is built on top of [OpenJDK JMH](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/), the preferred microbenchmarking solution for HotSpot. It has the "batteries included", so you don't need extra dependencies to get started.

## Running the Benchmarks

You can run the benchmarks from the command line through maven or directly in your IDE. To run all tests with the default settings, use `mvn -DskipTests=false test`. You need to explicitly set `skipTests=false` because we don't want to run the (potentially time consuming) microbenchmarks to be executed as unit tests during regular test runs.

If all goes well, you'll see JMH performing warmup and benchmark iterations on the number of forks, presenting you with nice a nice summary. Here's how a typical benchmark run looks like (you'll see lots of them in the output):

```
# Fork: 2 of 2
# Warmup: 10 iterations, 1 s each
# Measurement: 10 iterations, 1 s each
# Threads: 1 thread, will synchronize iterations
# Benchmark mode: Throughput, ops/time
# Running: io.netty.microbench.buffer.ByteBufAllocatorBenchmark.pooledDirectAllocAndFree_1_0
# Warmup Iteration   1: 8454.103 ops/ms
# Warmup Iteration   2: 11551.524 ops/ms
# Warmup Iteration   3: 11677.575 ops/ms
# Warmup Iteration   4: 11404.954 ops/ms
# Warmup Iteration   5: 11553.299 ops/ms
# Warmup Iteration   6: 11514.766 ops/ms
# Warmup Iteration   7: 11661.768 ops/ms
# Warmup Iteration   8: 11667.577 ops/ms
# Warmup Iteration   9: 11551.240 ops/ms
# Warmup Iteration  10: 11692.991 ops/ms
Iteration   1: 11633.877 ops/ms
Iteration   2: 11740.063 ops/ms
Iteration   3: 11751.798 ops/ms
Iteration   4: 11260.071 ops/ms
Iteration   5: 11461.010 ops/ms
Iteration   6: 11642.912 ops/ms
Iteration   7: 11808.595 ops/ms
Iteration   8: 11683.780 ops/ms
Iteration   9: 11750.292 ops/ms
Iteration  10: 11769.986 ops/ms

Result : 11650.238 Â±(99.9%) 229.698 ops/ms
  Statistics: (min, avg, max) = (11260.071, 11650.238, 11808.595), stdev = 169.080
  Confidence interval (99.9%): [11420.540, 11879.937]
```

Finally, the test output will looks similar to this (depending on your system setup and configuration):

You can also run the benchmarks directly from your IDE. If you've imported the netty parent project, open the `microbench` subproject and navigate to the `src/test/java/io/netty/microbench` namespace. In the `buffer` namespace, you can run the `ByteBufAllocatorBenchmark` like any other JUnit-based test. The main difference is that (as of now), you can only run the full benchmark at once, not each sub-benchmark individually. You should see the same output in the console as you did see when running it directly through `mvn`.

## Writing Benchmarks

Writing the benchmark itself is not hard, but getting it right is. This not because the microbench project is difficult to use, but more because you need to avoid common pitfalls when writing them. Thankfully, the JMH suite provides helpful annotations and features to mitigate most of them. To get started, you need to make your benchmark extend the `AbstractMicrobenchmark`, which makes sure the test gets run through JUnit and configures some defaults:

```java
public class MyBenchmark extends AbstractMicrobenchmark {

}
```

The next step is to create a method which is annotated with `@GenerateMicroBenchmark` (and give it a descriptive name):

```java
@GenerateMicroBenchmark
public void measureSomethingHere() {

}
```

The best idea now is to look [here](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/tip/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/) for samples and inspiration on how to write proper JMH tests. Also, check out [the talks](http://shipilev.net/#benchmarking) of one of the main authors from JMH.

## Customizing Runtime Conditions

The default settings (as found in `AbstractMicrobenchmark`) are:

 - Warmup Iterations: 10
 - Measure Iterations: 10
 - Number of Forks: 2

These settings can be customized through system properties at runtime (`warmupIterations`, `measureIterations` and `forks`):

```
mvn -DskipTests=false -DwarmupIterations=2 -DmeasureIterations=3 -Dforks=1 test
```

Note that it is generally not advised to use that few iterations, but it sometimes is helpful to see if the benchmark works and then run comprehensive benchmarks at a later point.

Note that you can also customize those default settings on a per-test basis through annotations:

```java
@Warmup(iterations = 20)
@Fork(1)
public class MyBenchmark extends AbstractMicrobenchmark {

}
```

This can be done on a per-class and per-method (benchmark) basis. Note that command line arguments always override the annotation defaults.
